# functional_programming
In this repository you will find two projects I developed for the course Functional Programming at Vrije Universiteit Brussel during the first semester of the 17-18 academic year.
Each folder contains the assignment specification and the code developed.

# Conclusions

From this course I got familiarized with concepts such as:
- referential transparency
- function composition
- Functors
- Applicative Functors
- Monoids
- Monads

It was one of my favorite courses and Haskell has without a doubt become one of my favorite programming languages thanks to it's strong type system and multiple features such as pattern matching, tuple support and syntax.
